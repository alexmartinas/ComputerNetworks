# Trafic Monitoring Simulator

I've made this project for the Computer Networks course and it was a client/server
application based on the TCP protocol for communication using sockets and threads.
The client had to choose a start point and his destination. Afther this, the server compute the shortest route using Belman-Ford algorithm and offer real time notifications for speed limits, street blockage or accidents. The client could also request for news about sport, politic or weather
Programming language: C
